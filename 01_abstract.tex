\section*{Abstract}
We present a novel trajectory distance metric that captures both aspects of the microaggregation process, namely clustering and obfuscation. We suggest a trajectory anonymisation heuristic approach based on this distance calculation that ensures each trajectory is indistinguishable from k1 other trajectories. The suggested distance calculation is loosely based on the Fr'echet distance, but it can be measured in quadratic time complexity. Empirical research on synthetic trajectories reveal that our anonymisation strategy outperforms previous study in terms of usefulness although preserving privacy.
