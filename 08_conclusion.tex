\section{Conclusion }~\label{sec:conclusion}
. The proposed distance measure resembles to other types of coupling distance measures, such as the FrÂ´echet
distance, with the particularity that the Infinite norm and the Manhattan norm
are considered together. To demonstrate the suitability of our distance measure,
we presented a trajectory-anonymisation heuristic method that creates cluster
with low intra-cluster distance and satisfies trajectory k-anonymity. Empirical
results show that our method offers better utility than other state-of-the-art
methods, such as the generalisation-based and permutation-based approaches
